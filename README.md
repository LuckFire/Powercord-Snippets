# Powercord Snippets
This repo is the predecessor of CSS Snippets (https://github.com/LuckFire/CSS-Snippets), which is now archived because of how poorly done it was. I will be remaking each snippet one by one, in both SCSS and CSS, so feel free to use whichever version suits your fancy. 

These were created to be thrown into themes or used as is, so if you'd like, feel free to use one of these in your themes!
