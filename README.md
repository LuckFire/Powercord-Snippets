# Powercord Snippets
This repo is the predecessor of CSS Snippets (https://github.com/LuckFire/CSS-Snippets), which is now archived. I will be remaking everything one by one, both SASS and CSS version of it, whatever you'd like to use. I created these to be thrown into themes or used as is, so if you'd like, feel free to use these in your themes if you'd like.
